# Cancer-Prediction
There are various types of genes and for each gene there are variations. So each individual, what gene and variation they have, the individual can be classified in nine categories. And some of these classes lead to some kind of cancer. The workflow is as follows: 1. A molecular pathologist selects a list of genetic variations of interest that he/she want to analyze 2. The molecular pathologist searches for evidence in the medical literature that is relevant to the genetic variations of interest. 3. Finally this molecular pathologist spends huge amount of time analyzing the evidence related to each of the variations to classify them into one of the nine categories. My Goal is to replace the step 3 with a ML Model. The molecular pathologist will still have to decide which variations are of interest, and also collect the relevant evidence for them. but the last step, which is also the most time consuming will be fully automated.  Problem statement: Classify the given variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature
